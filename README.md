# Distributed Proof-of-Deep-Learning (D-PoDL) - Prototype Implementation

This is an implementation of a prototype of the Distributed Proof-of-Deep-Learning (D-PoDL) concept proposed by Xiangyu Su, Mario Larangeira, and Keisuke Tanaka, as described in their paper "Provably Secure Blockchain Protocols from
Distributed Proof-of-Deep-Learning". The goal of D-PoDL is to use deep learning model training as a useful form of work, replacing traditional proof-of-work PoW algorithms like those used in Bitcoin.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
